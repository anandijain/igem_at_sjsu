Can more than one school be in one team?

Yes, two or more schools can join together to form a single team. The schools also do not need to be local to one another – we’ve had teams in the past with students from China and the United States on the same team! This allows a team to combine different backgrounds and talents to enrich the overall project. Just make sure to include all participants on the Team Roster.
